# Simple Product Checkout Page

This is a basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript project that displays a list of products with a checkout feature. When the user clicks the "Checkout" button, a summary section appears, and the main content fades out for emphasis.

## Features

- Product listing with images and prices
- Add-to-cart or checkout simulation
- Fading effect using JavaScript and CSS transitions
- Styled using pure CSS (no frameworks)

## How It Works

- Products are displayed using a flex layout.
- Clicking the 'Checkout' button triggers a JavaScript function that:
  - Fades the main content (`#main`) by changing its opacity to 4.0
  - Clicking the 'Order Again'button will fade back the 'main' (opacity: 1.0;)

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox, transitions, box-shadow)
- JavaScript

## How to Run

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Click on the **Checkout** button to see the fade effect and checkout popup.
